# 0x08-making_change
# Change Comes From Within

**Task**: Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

**Prototype**: `def makeChange(coins, total)`
- **Return**: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
- If total is 0 or less, return 0
- If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
- `coins` is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
- The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
- You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
- Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task

**Example**:

```python
# Main file for testing

makeChange = __import__('0-making_change').makeChange

print(makeChange([1, 2, 25], 37))  # Output: 7

print(makeChange([1256, 54, 48, 16, 102], 1453))  # Output: -1
